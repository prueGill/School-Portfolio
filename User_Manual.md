  <summary><h2><strong>The Prototype</strong></h2></summary>
Clique's prototype was designed using Figma, leveraging the platform's features to develop a user-friendly and visually appealing interface. 
The decision to use Figma was ideal for the team due to its strengths in real-time collaboration and interaction design. This allowed the 
designers to work together, create interactive prototypes, and ensure that the interface met the user needs.
